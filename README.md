Examples for the Lighter SQLite environment, SwiftUI and server side.

Note: The examples requires Swift 5.7 / Xcode 14b for proper plugin support.

When embedding a package using Lighter (like
[NorthwindSQLite.swift](https://github.com/Lighter-swift/NorthwindSQLite.swift.git)),
[a local package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/organizing-your-code-with-local-packages) 
seems to be required w/ the Xcode 14 beta.
Otherwise the Swift package plugins do not seem to run.
In the example project this is the "AppLogic" package.


### Examples

- [NorthwindWebAPI](Sources/NorthwindWebAPI/) (A server side Swift example
  exposing the DB as a JSON API endpoint, and providing a few pretty HTML pages
  showing data contained.)


### Dependencies

This example pulls in a lot of bigger dependencies. A real Lighter project can
actually work w/ no external dependencies at all.


### Who

Lighter is brought to you by
[Helge HeÃŸ](https://github.com/helje5/) / [ZeeZide](https://zeezide.de).

presumably any form of praise you can think of.
