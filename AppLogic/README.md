This is a helper package until Xcode 14 project level package dependencies
properly run package plugins.

It is generally a good idea to manage Xcode package dependencies in such a
local package.

Since the APIs require macOS 10.15 / iOS 13, this platforms declaration is
usually needed in the [Package.swift](Package.swift):
```swift
  platforms: [ .macOS(.v10_15), .iOS(.v13) ],
```
